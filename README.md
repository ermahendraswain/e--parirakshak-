‘e-parirakshak’, an AI & IoT device for SMART farming
 The device can monitor the fertility of the soil, water level required, soil temp and soil
moisture
 It will also provide a live feed of the field and remote access to water pumps, blower and
sprinklers through a hand-held LCD
 Will offer suggestions on the type of crop suitable for the field basis its fertility as well as
the amount of water, fertilizer and pesticide needed to grow it
 e-parirakshak’, an AI and IoT based system for smart farming. The device is a field information
and remote field management system rolled into one. It can monitor an agricultural field for its
fertility, keep track of water levels, soil temp and moisture as well as intelligently control water
pumps, blowers and sprinklers on the field from a remote location.
 E-parirakshak comprises of several sensor nodes which can be deployed in the field, a handheld
device with LCD screen which displays the field details and microcontrollers that remotely power
devices like sprinklers and water pumps on the field. Using the device, a farmer will be able to
monitor the fertility of the soil, water level required, soil temp and soil moisture and control the water
pumps, blower and sprinklers through sensors and actuators deployed in the field. Furthermore,
the system analyses the data gathered from the field through advanced machine learning algorithm
to find out the most suitable crop that can be grown on the field. It also suggests the amount of
water, fertilizer and pesticide needed to grow the suggested crop.
 Not only this, the device also detects any diseases or infections in the crop and updates the farmer
about them. The system can be used for both modern and traditional farming practices, i.e. - open
field, hydroponic and vertical farming. The device does not need an internet connection and works
within a range of 10kms with star topology. Its range can also be increased, if required by using
mesh topology.
